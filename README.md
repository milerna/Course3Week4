The repo contains the following 4 files:

  README: Explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

  CodeBook.md: a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that were performed to clean up the       data

  run_analysis.R: an R file, that does the following:

  Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
  From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each     subject.

  tidy.txt: data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.
