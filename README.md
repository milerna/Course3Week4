Coursera Assignment

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

The repo contains the following 4 files:

 1. README: Explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

 2. run_analysis.R: an R file, that does the following:

  * Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  * Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
  * Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  * Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
  * From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each     subject.
  
 In order for run_analysis.R to run, the data has to be downloaded and unzipped.
  
 3. CodeBook.md: a code book that describes the data, the transformations that were performed and the varables in the final dataset.
 
 4. tidydata.txt: data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
